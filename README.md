Unfair Rock Paper Scissors because that's how life is too.

Welcome to the bleak reality of Unfair Rock, Paper, Scissors, where the shadows of life's uncertainties loom large. 

In this twisted version of the classic game, the computer stands as a relentless arbiter of fate, casting a shadow over every move you dare to make. 

With each round, you're confronted with the harsh truth that, as Thanos once said, "Reality is often disappointing." 

Life doesn't always follow a predictable path. 

No matter how carefully you strategize or how intuitively you choose, the outcome remains shrouded in darkness, leaving you grappling with the cruel whims of chance. 

This isn't a game of mere rock, paper, and scissors; it's a chilling reflection of life's relentless and unforgiving nature. 

Can you find a glimmer of hope amidst the shadows, or will you be consumed by the abyss of defeat? 

Enter this dark realm, where the line between victory and despair blurs, and discover the unsettling truth that life is never what it seems.
